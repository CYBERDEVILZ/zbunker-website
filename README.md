ZBunker is a community run by a bunch of university students with an aim to spread awareness about open source and the power of programmming.

The main mode of education is throught our YouTube channel, where we will walk you through some of the popular programming languages and how you can develop a skill set in the tech domain.

We believe in free and quality education for all.
