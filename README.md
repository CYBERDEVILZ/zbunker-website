# ZBUNKER

![ZB logo](zbunker/static/img/zglitch-inverted.gif)

ZBunker is a community run by a bunch of university students with an aim to spread awareness about **open source** and the power of **programmming**.

The main mode of education is through our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1QZPervOHLiC4xpVnzbDFg), where we will walk you through some of the popular programming languages and how you can develop a skill set in the tech domain.

We believe in ***free and quality education for all***.
