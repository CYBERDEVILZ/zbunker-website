ZBunker is a community run by a bunch of university students with an aim to spread awareness about **open source** and the power of **programmming**.

The main mode of education is through our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1QZPervOHLiC4xpVnzbDFg), where we will walk you through some of the popular programming languages and how you can develop a skill set in the tech domain.

We believe in ***free and quality education for all***.

## Getting Started / Viewing Project üõ∞Ô∏è

- ### Installing Python

    This Project breathes and lives on **Python**. You need to have Python in your system to view this project. Head over to the [official website](https://www.python.org) and download the latest version. You can also watch this video about [installing Python](https://youtu.be/MGhDEeIkarg)

    If you want to learn **Python**, you can refer to this [basic Python course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbsliZj8JocLu8b_13sVPZUciUBaLpMVw)

- ### Installing Dependencies

    The **packages and modules** you need to run *`zbunker-website`* is listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can **install them** via this command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- ### Running the Project

    Open up your **terminal (cmd in windows)** and navigate inside the Project directory: `zbunker-website/`. Then simply run this command:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

    This would spit out some verbose (simply ignore them). You **only need to look for something similar to** `Running on http://127.0.0.1:xxxx` where xxx is port no. Copy this code and paste it on your **web browser**.

     Voila! ZBunker website is **up and running**!
